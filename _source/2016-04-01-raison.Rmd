This is a blog about beer, battles, and barbeque. I would like to visit as many
breweries and barbeque joints in the USofA that I can. Oh, and also American 
battle sites along the way. This is where I plan on chronicling it all. It 
may end up being a very short blog, but that's the plan anyway.

This will end up being mostly about beer and barbeque I would guess. Stuff about 
battle fields will be minimal.
